      "obama talks about himself  times in speeches supposedly about hillary  things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about  trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life  trump was named in epsteins little black book epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman  trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends  both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists  epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir  at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians  trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened there is no debate over what happened said one of roberts attorneys i served mr trump with a subpoena for deposition in  he talked to me voluntarily and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information i cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this additionally garten told vice news in january that mr trump has no relationship with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trumps maralago a lot of people hung out there including jeffrey epstein said garten that is the only connection according to the evidence however the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that tags\n",
